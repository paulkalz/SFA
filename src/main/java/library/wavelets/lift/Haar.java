/**
 <p>
 Haar (flat line) wavelet.
 </p>

 <p>
 As with all Lifting scheme wavelet transform functions, the
 first stage of a transform step is the split stage.  The
 split step moves the even element to the first half of an
 N element region and the odd elements to the second half of the N
 element region.
 </p>

 <p>
 The Lifting Scheme version of the Haar transform uses a wavelet
 function (predict stage) that "predicts" that an odd element will
 have the same value as it preceeding even element.  Stated another
 way, the odd element is "predicted" to be on a flat (zero slope
 line) shared with the even point.  The difference between this
 "prediction" and the actual odd value replaces the odd element.
 </p>

 <p>
 The wavelet scaling function (a.k.a. smoothing function) used
 in the update stage calculates the average between an even and
 an odd element.
 </p>

 <p>
 The merge stage at the end of the inverse transform interleaves
 odd and even elements from the two halves of the array
 (e.g., ordering them even<sub>0</sub>, odd<sub>0</sub>,
 even<sub>1</sub>, odd<sub>1</sub>, ...)

   <p>
   Update step of the Haar wavelet transform.
   </p>
   <p>
   The wavelet transform calculates a set of detail or
   difference coefficients in the predict step.  These
   are stored in the upper half of the array.  The update step
   calculates an average from the even-odd element pairs.
   The averages will replace the even elements in the 
   lower half of the array.
   </p>
   <p>
   The Haar wavelet calculation used in the Lifting Scheme
   is
   </p>
   <pre>
   d<sub>j+1, i</sub> = odd<sub>j+1, i</sub> = odd<sub>j, i</sub> - even<sub>j, i</sub>
   a<sub>j+1, i</sub> = even<sub>j, i</sub> = (even<sub>j, i</sub> + odd<sub>j, i</sub>)/2
   </pre>
   <p>
   Note that the Lifting Scheme uses an in-place algorithm.  The odd
   elements have been replaced by the detail coefficients in the
   predict step.  With a little algebra we can substitute the
   coefficient calculation into the average calculation, which
   gives us
   </p>
   <pre>
   a<sub>j+1, i</sub> = even<sub>j, i</sub> = even<sub>j, i</sub> + (odd<sub>j, i</sub>/2)
